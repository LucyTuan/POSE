# POSE
The purpose of our project is image recognition with AI to make virtual avatars with synchronized actions and interact with the environment. Also, we develop a platform that can control virtual avatars through image recognition to replace joysticks and reduce costs.

By using only the camera to achieve pose inspection, the overall environment can be easily reproduced.
In the future, we hope to deploy the system to various private devices through the server to achieve the goal of user interaction. The target device will be any platform capable of computing, such as windows, ubuntu, M1 mac, jetson nano, etc.
